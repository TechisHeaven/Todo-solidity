# Hardhat and React Smart Contract Project

This repository contains a sample project demonstrating the integration of Hardhat for Ethereum smart contract development with React as the frontend framework. The project also uses Ganache for local blockchain deployment, and Solidity as the programming language for smart contracts. ReactJS is employed for the frontend, with state management for smart contract interaction.
